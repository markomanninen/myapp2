select entities from the App Engine datastore.

A Query encapsulates a request for zero or more Entity objects out of
the datastore. It supports querying on zero or more properties,
querying by ancestor, and sorting. Entity objects which match the
query can be retrieved in a single list, or with an unbounded
iterator."}
